Color palette and typography guide
Exportable assets for development

6. Timeline
Please let me know how long it would take to design each stage (wireframes + high-fidelity).

7. Additional Notes
This website is ministry-centered, so the feel should be:
Peaceful
Clean
Inspirational
Professional

I aim for something visually excellent and easy for users to navigate, especially first-time visitors seeking sermons, videos, and ministry details.

Please let me know if you need any clarification or additional details.
I look forward to working with you and seeing your creative direction for DRF.

Thank you!
